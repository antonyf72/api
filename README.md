API v2 Documentation
===

This is a REST-style API that uses JSON for serialization and OAuth 2 for authentication

Making a request

All URLs are prefixed with `/api/v2/`

Authentication

Read the [authentication guide](https://github.com/devhub/api/blob/master/sections/authentication.md) to get started.

Errors

Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. More details on [handling errors and validation](https://github.com/devhub/api/blob/master/sections/errors.md).
